## Key Decisions Made

1. **Directory Naming**: Changed from `invoice-extractor` to `invoice_extractor` (underscore) to support Python imports

2. **Parquet Schema**: Selected Hive-style partitioning by `vendor_type` for efficient querying and organization

3. **Quality Scoring**: Implemented 3-metric system (blur 40%, resolution 30%, contrast 30%) with custom convolution to avoid heavy dependencies

4. **Validation Layers**: Three-layer approach ensures data quality at schema, business logic, and cross-field consistency levels

5. **LLM Fallback**: Primary-fallback strategy (Gemini → OpenRouter) with automatic retry and tenacity decorators

6. **Mock LLM Mode**: Added `USE_MOCK_LLM` flag for testing without API calls, critical for development

7. **Cost Tracking**: Built-in cost calculation with configurable rates per 1M tokens

8. **Credentials Deferral**: Task 1.1 deferred to user setup - system fully functional without credentials for development/testing

## Architecture Highlights

### Pipeline Flow

```
Input File (TIFF/PDF/PNG)
    ↓
ImageProcessor → PNG bytes + hash
    ↓
QualityScorer → Score + metrics
    ↓ [Quality check passes]
PromptManager → Vendor-specific prompt
    ↓
LLMGateway (Gemini/OpenRouter) → Raw JSON
    ↓
Validator (3 layers) → Validated InvoiceData
    ↓
ResultAggregator → ExtractionResult
    ↓
ParquetWriter → data/output/vendor_type=XX/*.parquet
    ↓
FileArchiver → data/store/vendor_type=XX/*
```

### Key Features

1. **Vendor-Optimized**: 6 vendor types (UberEats, DoorDash, GrubHub, iFood, Rappi, Other)
2. **Resilient**: Primary-fallback LLM strategy with automatic retry
3. **Validated**: Three-layer validation (schema, business, consistency)
4. **Quality-Aware**: Image assessment with configurable threshold
5. **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive logging, error handling, type safety
6. **Testable**: Mock LLM mode, extensive test suite, smoke test script
