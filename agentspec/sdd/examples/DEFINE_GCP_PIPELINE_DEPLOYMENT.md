## Problem Statement

The team needs a working GCP infrastructure with functional Cloud Run services to develop, test, and validate the AI-powered invoice extraction pipeline. Currently, no infrastructure exists and no function code has been written, blocking all development and testing activities. The April 1, 2026 production deadline requires rapid deployment of a complete dev environment.

---

## Target Users

| User | Role | Pain Point |
|------|------|------------|
| Data Engineer | Pipeline developer | No infrastructure to deploy and test data flows |
| ML Engineer | Gemini prompt developer | No extraction function to test and iterate on prompts |
| QA Engineer | Validation specialist | No end-to-end flow to run acceptance tests |
| DevOps | Infrastructure manager | No baseline infrastructure to evolve into production |

---

## Goals

| Priority | Goal |
|----------|------|
| **MUST** | Deploy all 7 GCS buckets with proper lifecycle policies |
| **MUST** | Create Pub/Sub topic chain (5 topics + 5 DLQs) with event flow |
| **MUST** | Provision BigQuery dataset with 3 tables (extractions, line_items, logs) |
| **MUST** | Implement and deploy 4 Cloud Run functions with proper IAM |
| **MUST** | Establish working event chain: GCS → Pub/Sub → Cloud Run → BigQuery |
| **MUST** | Validate end-to-end flow with synthetic TIFF invoices |
| **SHOULD** | Document all deployment commands in executable scripts |
| **SHOULD** | Provide cleanup/teardown commands for resource management |
| **COULD** | Include health check and monitoring commands |

---

## Success Criteria

Measurable outcomes for deployment completion:

## Out of Scope

Explicitly NOT included in this deployment:

| Item | Reason | Future Phase |
|------|--------|--------------|
| LangFuse observability | No API keys available | Phase 2 |
| OpenRouter fallback LLM | No API keys available | Phase 2 |
| Terraform/Terragrunt IaC | Adds complexity for initial deploy | Phase 3 |
| CI/CD pipeline automation | Out of scope for manual deployment | Phase 3 |
| CrewAI autonomous monitoring | Phase 2 feature per requirements | Phase 2 |
| Production environment | Dev environment first | Phase 4 |
| Load testing | Performance optimization later | Phase 3 |
| Multi-region deployment | Single region (us-central1) for dev | Phase 4 |
| Custom domains | Not needed for dev | Phase 4 |
| VPC configuration | Default VPC sufficient for dev | Phase 3 |

---

## Constraints

| Type | Constraint | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Technical** | Gemini-only LLM (no fallback) | Extraction function simpler but less resilient |
| **Technical** | No existing function code | Must write all 4 functions from scratch |
| **Technical** | gcloud CLI only (no Terraform) | Manual deployment, harder to reproduce |
| **Environment** | Dev environment only | `invoice-pipeline-dev` project |
| **Region** | us-central1 only | All resources in single region |
| **Timeline** | April 1, 2026 production deadline | Must complete dev deployment quickly |
| **Budget** | Estimated ~$20/month for dev | Resource limits: max 10 instances per function |

---

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | If Wrong, Impact | Validated? |
|----|------------|------------------|------------|
| A-001 | GCP project `invoice-pipeline-dev` exists with billing enabled | Cannot deploy any resources | [ ] |
| A-002 | User has Owner or Editor role on the project | IAM commands will fail | [ ] |
| A-003 | Vertex AI API is enabled with Gemini 2.0 Flash access | Extraction function will fail | [ ] |
| A-004 | gcloud CLI is installed and authenticated | All commands will fail | [ ] |
| A-005 | Docker is installed for building Cloud Run images | Cannot deploy functions | [ ] |
| A-006 | Synthetic TIFFs are valid multi-page TIFF format | Converter function may fail | [x] |
| A-007 | Gemini API key is available for Secret Manager | Extraction won't authenticate | [ ] |
| A-008 | Network allows outbound HTTPS to Vertex AI | LLM calls will timeout | [ ] |
