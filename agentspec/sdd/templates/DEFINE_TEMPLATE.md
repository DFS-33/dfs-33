# DEFINE: {Feature Name}

> One-sentence description of what we're building

## Metadata

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Feature** | {FEATURE_NAME} |
| **Date** | {YYYY-MM-DD} |
| **Author** | {author} |
| **Status** | {Draft / In Progress / Needs Clarification / Ready for Design} |
| **Clarity Score** | {X}/15 |

---

## Problem Statement

{1-2 sentences describing the pain point we're solving. Be specific about who has the problem and what the impact is.}

---

## Target Users

| User | Role | Pain Point |
|------|------|------------|
| {User 1} | {Their role} | {What frustrates them} |
| {User 2} | {Their role} | {What frustrates them} |

---

## Goals

What success looks like (prioritized):

| Priority | Goal |
|----------|------|
| **MUST** | {Primary goal - non-negotiable for MVP} |
| **MUST** | {Another critical goal} |
| **SHOULD** | {Important but can defer if timeline tight} |
| **COULD** | {Nice-to-have if time permits} |

**Priority Guide:**
- **MUST** = MVP fails without this
- **SHOULD** = Important, but workaround exists
- **COULD** = Nice-to-have, cut first if needed

---

## Success Criteria

Measurable outcomes (must include numbers):

- [ ] {Metric 1: e.g., "Handle 1000 requests per minute"}
- [ ] {Metric 2: e.g., "Achieve 99.9% uptime"}
- [ ] {Metric 3: e.g., "Response time under 200ms"}

---

## Acceptance Tests

| ID | Scenario | Given | When | Then |
|----|----------|-------|------|------|
| AT-001 | {Happy path} | {Initial state} | {Action} | {Expected result} |
| AT-002 | {Error case} | {Initial state} | {Action} | {Expected result} |
| AT-003 | {Edge case} | {Initial state} | {Action} | {Expected result} |

---

## Out of Scope

Explicitly NOT included in this feature:

- {Item 1: What we're NOT doing}
- {Item 2: What's deferred to future}
- {Item 3: What's explicitly excluded}

---

## Constraints

| Type | Constraint | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Technical | {e.g., "Must use existing database schema"} | {How this affects design} |
| Timeline | {e.g., "Must ship by Q1"} | {How this affects scope} |
| Resource | {e.g., "No additional infrastructure budget"} | {How this affects approach} |

---

## Technical Context

> Essential context for Design phase - prevents misplaced files and missed infrastructure needs.

| Aspect | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Deployment Location** | {src/ \| functions/ \| gen/ \| deploy/ \| custom path} | {Why this location} |
| **KB Domains** | {pydantic, gcp, gemini, langfuse, terraform, crewai, openrouter} | {Which patterns to consult} |
| **IaC Impact** | {New resources \| Modify existing \| None \| TBD} | {Terraform/Terragrunt changes needed} |

**Why This Matters:**

- **Location** → Design phase uses correct project structure, prevents misplaced files
- **KB Domains** → Design phase pulls correct patterns from `agentspec/kb/`
- **IaC Impact** → Triggers infrastructure planning, avoids "works locally" failures

---

## Assumptions

Assumptions that if wrong could invalidate the design:

| ID | Assumption | If Wrong, Impact | Validated? |
|----|------------|------------------|------------|
| A-001 | {e.g., "Database can handle expected load"} | {Would need caching layer} | [ ] |
| A-002 | {e.g., "Request volume stays under 1000/hour"} | {Would need rate limiting} | [ ] |
| A-003 | {e.g., "Users have modern browsers"} | {Would need polyfills for legacy support} | [ ] |

**Note:** Validate critical assumptions before DESIGN phase. Unvalidated assumptions become risks.

## Clarity Score Breakdown

| Element | Score (0-3) | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Problem | {0-3} | {Why this score} |
| Users | {0-3} | {Why this score} |
| Goals | {0-3} | {Why this score} |
| Success | {0-3} | {Why this score} |
| Scope | {0-3} | {Why this score} |
| **Total** | **{X}/15** | |

**Scoring Guide:**
- 0 = Missing entirely
- 1 = Vague or incomplete
- 2 = Clear but missing details
- 3 = Crystal clear, actionable

**Minimum to proceed: 12/15**
