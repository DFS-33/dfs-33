---

## Quick Start

### Starting a New Feature (with Brainstorm)

```bash
# Phase 0: Explore the idea (optional but recommended for vague ideas)
/brainstorm "I want to build a user notification system"

# Phase 1: Define requirements (from brainstorm output)
/define agentspec/sdd/features/BRAINSTORM_USER_NOTIFICATIONS.md

# Phase 2: Create technical design
/design agentspec/sdd/features/DEFINE_USER_NOTIFICATIONS.md

# Phase 3: Build the code
/build agentspec/sdd/features/DESIGN_USER_NOTIFICATIONS.md

# Phase 4: Archive when complete
/ship agentspec/sdd/features/DEFINE_USER_NOTIFICATIONS.md
```

### Starting with Clear Requirements (skip Brainstorm)

```bash
# Phase 1: Define requirements directly
/define "Build a REST API for user management"

# Continue with /design → /build → /ship
```

### Making Changes Mid-Stream

```bash
# Update BRAINSTORM with new approach
/iterate BRAINSTORM_USER_AUTH.md "Consider using OAuth instead of custom tokens"

# Update DEFINE with new requirement
/iterate DEFINE_DATA_EXPORT.md "Add support for CSV format"

# Update DESIGN with architecture change
/iterate DESIGN_DATA_EXPORT.md "Components need to be self-contained"
```

## Phase Details

### Phase 0: Brainstorm (Optional)

**Purpose:** Explore ideas through collaborative dialogue before capturing requirements.

**When to Use:**
- Vague idea that needs exploration
- Multiple possible approaches to consider
- Uncertain about scope or users
- Need to apply YAGNI before diving in

**When to Skip:**
- Clear requirements already known
- Meeting notes with explicit asks
- Simple feature request

**Input:** Raw idea, problem statement, or vague request.

**Output:** `BRAINSTORM_{FEATURE}.md` with:
- Discovery questions and answers
- 2-3 approaches explored with trade-offs
- Selected approach with reasoning
- Features removed (YAGNI applied)
- Draft requirements for /define

**Process:**
1. One question at a time (never dump questions)
2. Multiple-choice preferred
3. Present 2-3 approaches with recommendation
4. Validate understanding incrementally (200-300 word sections)
5. Apply YAGNI ruthlessly

**Quality Gate:** Min 3 questions, 2+ approaches, 2+ validations, user confirmed

### Phase 1: Define

**Purpose:** Capture and validate requirements from any input.

**Input:** BRAINSTORM document, raw notes, emails, conversations, or direct requirements.

**Output:** `DEFINE_{FEATURE}.md` with:
- Problem statement
- Target users
- Success criteria (measurable)
- Acceptance tests (Given/When/Then)
- Out of scope

**Quality Gate:** Clarity Score ≥ 12/15

### Phase 2: Design

**Purpose:** Create complete technical design with inline decisions.

**Input:** `DEFINE_{FEATURE}.md`

**Output:** `DESIGN_{FEATURE}.md` with:
- Architecture diagram (ASCII)
- Key decisions with rationale
- File manifest (all files to create)
- Code patterns (copy-paste ready)
- Testing strategy

**Quality Gate:** Complete file manifest, no shared dependencies

### Phase 3: Build

**Purpose:** Execute implementation following the design.

**Input:** `DESIGN_{FEATURE}.md`

**Output:**
- Code files (as specified in manifest)
- `BUILD_REPORT_{FEATURE}.md`

**Process:**
1. Parse file manifest from DESIGN
2. Order by dependencies
3. Create each file with verification
4. Run full validation (lint, tests)

**Quality Gate:** All tasks complete, all tests pass

### Phase 4: Ship

**Purpose:** Archive completed feature with lessons learned.

**Input:** All feature artifacts

**Output:**
- `archive/{FEATURE}/` folder with all documents
- `SHIPPED_{DATE}.md` with lessons learned

## Key Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single Stream** | No mode switching, one unified workflow |
| **Inline Decisions** | ADRs in DESIGN document, not separate files |
| **On-the-Fly Tasks** | Tasks generated from file manifest during build |
| **Self-Contained** | Each deployable unit works independently |
| **Config Over Code** | Use YAML for configuration, not hardcoded values |
| **Iterate Anywhere** | Changes can be made at any phase via `/iterate` |

---

## Model Assignment

| Phase | Model | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Brainstorm | Opus | Creative thinking and nuanced dialogue |
| Define | Opus | Nuanced understanding of requirements |
| Design | Opus | Architectural decisions require depth |
| Build | Sonnet | Fast, accurate code generation |
| Ship | Haiku | Simple archival operations |
| Iterate | Sonnet | Balanced speed and understanding |
