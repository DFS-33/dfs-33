## What It Does

The `/telemetry` command analyzes your shipped features and generates actionable insights:

1. **Reads session data** from `agentspec/telemetry/sessions/`
2. **Computes aggregates** (phase timing, agent effectiveness, trends)
3. **Generates reports** in `agentspec/telemetry/reports/`
4. **Provides recommendations** based on patterns

## Report Types

### Latest Report (`/telemetry report`)
- All-time or last 30 days
- Full analysis with recommendations
- Saved to `REPORT_LATEST.md`

### Weekly Report (`/telemetry report --weekly`)
- Current week's features
- Week-over-week trends
- Saved to `REPORT_YYYY-WNN.md`

### Monthly Report (`/telemetry report --monthly`)
- Current month's features
- Month-over-month trends
- Saved to `REPORT_YYYY-MM.md`

### Quick Summary (`/telemetry summary`)
- Console output only
- Key metrics at a glance
- No file generated

## Data Sources

Telemetry reads from:
- `agentspec/sdd/archive/*/` - Shipped feature artifacts
- `agentspec/telemetry/sessions/` - Session JSON files

Session data is captured automatically when you run `/ship --telemetry`.

## Integration with /ship

To capture telemetry automatically:

```bash
/ship DEFINE_MY_FEATURE.md --telemetry
```

This will:
1. Archive the feature (normal /ship behavior)
2. Extract metrics from artifacts
3. Save session JSON to `agentspec/telemetry/sessions/`
4. Update aggregates

---

## Privacy

All telemetry is **local only**:
- Data never leaves your machine
- No external APIs called
- You control all data
- Delete anytime: `rm -rf agentspec/telemetry/`
