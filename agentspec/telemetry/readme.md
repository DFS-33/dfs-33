# AgentSpec Telemetry

> Local analytics for understanding your AgentSpec usage

---

## Overview

Telemetry captures metrics from your shipped features to help you:
- Understand phase timing and bottlenecks
- Measure agent effectiveness
- Identify patterns and improvements
- Generate actionable reports

**All data is local.** Nothing leaves your machine.

---

## Quick Start

### Capture telemetry when shipping

```bash
/ship DEFINE_MY_FEATURE.md --telemetry
```

### Generate a report

```bash
/telemetry report
```

### View quick summary

```bash
/telemetry summary
```

## What Gets Captured

### Phase Metrics
- Duration per phase (brainstorm, define, design, build)
- Clarity scores (from define)
- Technical context (location, KB domains, IaC impact)
- Iteration count (from build)

### Agent Metrics
- Which agents were used
- Files assigned per agent
- Success/failure per agent
- Quality scores (if Judge enabled)

### Feature Metrics
- Total duration
- File count
- Test count
- Ship success

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/telemetry report` | Generate full report (REPORT_LATEST.md) |
| `/telemetry report --weekly` | Generate weekly report |
| `/telemetry report --monthly` | Generate monthly report |
| `/telemetry summary` | Quick console summary |
| `/telemetry sessions` | List all session files |

---

## Integration

### With /ship

Add `--telemetry` flag to capture session data:

```bash
/ship DEFINE_INVOICE_PIPELINE.md --telemetry
```

### Future: Auto-capture

Session capture could be automatic for all shipped features:

```yaml
# agentspec/settings.yaml (future)
telemetry:
  auto_capture: true
  reports:
    auto_generate: weekly
```

---

## Privacy

- **Local only**: Data never leaves your machine
- **No PII**: Only metrics, never content
- **User controlled**: Delete anytime with `rm -rf agentspec/telemetry/`
- **Opt-in**: Only captures when you use `--telemetry` flag
